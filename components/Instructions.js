                3.Soak the cut potatoes in a bowl of cold water for about 30

                <br />
                2. In separate shallow dishes, prepare two coatings: one with
                plain flour seasoned with salt, pepper, and dried mint, and the
                other with beaten eggs.
                <br />
                3. Dip each fillet first into the seasoned flour, then into the
                beaten egg, and finally coat it thoroughly with breadcrumbs.

                4. Heat the remaining oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat.

                to the pan.

                6. Fry each fillet for about 3-4 minutes on each side until
                golden brown and the fish is cooked through. Place them on a
                paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
